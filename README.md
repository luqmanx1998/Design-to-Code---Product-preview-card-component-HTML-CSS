# Challenges faced :

This has been a relatively simple challenge, with just HTML and CSS, however I did run into issues with responsive images, which I managed to fix with guides from mdn web docs [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

While it may not be pixel perfect, this is a free challenge, and every spacing was eye-balled. It ended up taking me longer than I'd expected due to trying to make it pixel perfect, but for the sake of practice this looks good to me ! I think I'm happy with this one and on to the next one !
